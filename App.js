/**
 *    README:
 * 
 *    This is a basic setup that has most of the npm packages and settings that
 *    you'll want for a project (keep it as a reference)
 *    
 *    Included npm packages that you'd have to install yourself if setting up from scratch:
 *    -> axios
 *    -> react-redux
 *    -> redux
 *    -> redux-thunk
 *    -> react-navigation
 *    
 *    Redux is setup with both thunk applied and react navigation wrapped.
 *    There is a folder structure for redux available in 'components' as well
